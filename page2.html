            <h3 class = "title">My Father</h3>
            <p> Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to become a law enforcement officer like my father. He has gone through many stages of
                rank since he entered the police force, switching from an officer to a detective, and now to a lieutenant. I've admired my father's
                strength for a long time because of his commitment to his work and dedication to providing for his family; this is the trait I hope
                most to cherish in my memories of him long after I achieve my future goals. Most importantly, he inspired me to want to use my talents
                and passion for coding and computer system to connect it with the modern age of investigation by working for the FBI as a digital
                forensics examiner.

            <h3 class = "title">Becoming a Digital Forensics Examiner</h3>
            <p> My interest in computers combined with my father's legacy as a law enforcement officer inspired me to take my two interests and combine
                them into a career. Part of my--and my significant other's--criteria for my career was that I would be able to go to work and come home safely
                every day. Obviously being a police officer or federal law enforcement agent poses a risk with it, so being a digital forensics examiner
                seemed like the choice for me. I love watching television shows where the officers have to go to the crime lab and meet with the forensics
                examiners to determine who was using what device, and the thought of uncovering deleted files to help solve crimes sounds so interesting and
                exciting to me.

                My mentors always told me to find the work I can enjoy doing everyday, and I think this career not only offers a different task every single day,
                but opens up doors to bigger agencys than just local police offices, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
