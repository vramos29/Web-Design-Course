            <h3>Law Enforcement</h3>
            <p> Since the formation of modern civilization, different forms of law enforcement have existed and adapted over
                time to suit the evolved changes of society. Think back to some of the earliest forms of this system that you
                can think of: Roman centurions, royal guards, sheriffs and marshals, and, of course, modern day police and federal
                officers. These brave people are not meant to inflict harm onto civilians, but rather protect them from danger and
                those deemed to pose threats. This task, which is not an easy burden to carry, is done so by those with the strength
                to face death every single day they enter the field. This article will discuss why law enforcement should be supported,
                not defunded or abolished; because, in the end, without law enforcement, there would be no one to protect us
                from the same dangers they face every single day.

                <h3>Reasons Why Law Enforcement Is Necessary</h3>
                
                <p> Imagine there was a situation where a family was home and someone broke into their house. They would not
                    call the fire department or the ambulence. They would call the police to come and safe them. More times than not
                    law enforcement officers are looked down upon for their line of work because people do not recgonize the 
                    sacrifices they make every single day to ensure communal safety.

                    Law Enforcement can always come in different forms federally and locally. For example:
